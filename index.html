        <div class="content">Principal Engineer at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">AWS Bedrock</a>, leading multiple projects enabling tens of thousands of enterprise customers to use generative AI safely and at scale. Led Guardrails, AWS's responsible AI service for implementing safety controls on LLM applications. Built the APIs and hosted the service end-to-end. Built the ML infrastructure: model training pipelines, data labeling workflows, model hosting on custom inference chips, fine-tuning systems, and trust & safety classifiers for Anthropic and other foundation models. Built the distributed systems infrastructure for Guardrails: throttling and rate limiting, admission control for fair resource allocation, noisy neighbor isolation, scheduling systems for traffic management, and schema abstraction layers for rapid model onboarding enabling day-0 support for new models. Also led Amazon's internal LLM evaluation platform, the company-wide infrastructure used by all teams at Amazon building and evaluating LLMs, with multi-tenant data isolation supporting accuracy benchmarking, safety assessment, and coding evaluations across dozens of models. Later designed and led AWS Bedrock Evaluations, the public product, using the same building blocks to bring evaluation capabilities to external customers.</div>

        <div class="content">Technical lead for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">AWS Lex</a> speech recognition. Built the hybrid HMM/DNN architecture using an internal version of Kaldi. Developed personalized grammars and custom language models to improve transcription accuracy for customer-specific vocabularies and domains. Architected cellular infrastructure with hot-loading model capabilities enabling zero-downtime deployments across production fleet. Built real-time bi-directional streaming with Voice Activity Detection for natural turn-taking. Created scalable framework for multi-language expansion supporting Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and European languages.</div>

        <div class="content">Built Amazon's real-time <b>payment fraud detection</b> platform. Architected industry-first inline fraud evaluation during checkout, building risk signals throughout the user journey and using them before payment. The system runs at ordering scale with fraud checks happening through the checkout process in small batches. Designed data caching architecture for single-click checkout scenarios, running inline lightweight checks within 100ms latency constraints. The architecture was key to meeting checkout page performance bar. This same system was also used to make Amazon PSD2 compliant, handling the multi-factor authentication requirements. Significantly reduced chargebacks while maintaining seamless customer experience.</div>

        <div class="content">Software engineer at <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a>. Built fraud evaluation pipelines, feature stores, and ML infrastructure running during fulfillment (after order placement). This was the pre-checkout fraud era: handled chargebacks, supported manual investigators, processed disputes. The later evolution to checkout-time fraud detection simplified operations significantly and reduced chargebacks. Also built KYC workflow orchestration for European sellers handling 100K concurrent workflows with complex state machine logic and regulatory compliance.</div>
